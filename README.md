- **`npm start`** - starts both backend and frontend (using `concurrently`)
- **`npm run rull`** - fetches changes from the repo (`git pull origin master --rebase --autostash`)
- **`npm run upd`** - fetches changes from the repo, execute `npm i` to install dependencies on front and backend and start them

To get up and running - clone the repo, navigate to the root folder and run **`npm run upd`**
